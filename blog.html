        <p>The first time someone told me I looked mean, we were sitting on the gym floor after class. Riley was stretching, her sneakers squeaking on the polished wood.
            <br>
            “You look mean,” she said, almost like she was pointing out the color of my shirt. Mean. The word stuck itself in my head, sharp and clanging around while I tried to laugh it off. In the hallway mirrors, I caught my reflection, and I could almost see it something rigid in my face, like a closed door.
            <br>
            Walking home, I wondered if it was even true, or just how Riley saw me because I didn’t smooth my edges for her. Maybe mean was just how people saw anything that didn’t fit neatly.</p>

        <p>The tree grew crooked in our yard, its roots gripping the earth as if afraid to fall into the sky. Mother said it was a cursed tree. She would pull the fruit down before it ripened, smashing the green mangoes.<br>
            “The tree eats the sweetness from the soil, leaving us with nothing but bitterness” she said, tossing the ruined flesh into a bucket.
            But I would wait. When the fruit blushed gold and orange, I climbed the tree and pulled them from its trembling branches. I bit it. Juice running down my chin and as sticky as a broken promise.<br>
            “What did I tell you?” my mother hissed one evening when she caught me, her voice like the snap of branches in a storm. “You eat what the tree gives you, and the tree will eat you back.” That night, I dreamed my bones were the roots, my spine the trunk. The tree grew from my back, splitting me open, reaching for the stars. When I woke, my skin smelled of mangoes and sap, my breath of dirt and rain.<br>
            My mother didn’t say anything when I walked outside, barefoot, to stand under the tree. I pressed my hand to its bark, my heartbeat echoing in its veins.<br>
            The tree is mine now. It drinks from me, and I drink from it. Together, we will grow crooked.</p>

        <p> Marcus had lived in the apartment for two years, but this evening, the small, oddly shaped corner of his closet pulsed with an unfamiliar energy. It was just a place where he stored old boxes and winter coats, a neglected part of his life. Yet tonight, it seemed to call out to him, whispering secrets he was too afraid to uncover.
            As he approached, a draft stirred the air, cold but inviting, almost like it was gesturing to him to come over. It felt as if the closet was alive, remembering the stories buried within its confines. He paused, letting his nostalgia takeover, mixed with a hint of dread.
            <br>
            Pushing the door aside, the wooden panel shifted under his touch, revealing a narrow passage. Stepping through, Marcus felt the dust clinging to the air, remnants of forgotten moments, just like his own past. Each breath he took felt heavy with memories not his own, and the damp, earthy smell wrapped around him like a nasty quilt.
            His flashlight illuminated a tight space, revealing crumpled boxes dangerously stacked, remnants of lives lived long ago. Among them, something caught his eye. It was a delicate porcelain doll, chipped and faded.
            <br>
            In the far corner, a door loomed, shadowy and foreboding. He felt an urge to pull away, to abandon this adventure. Yet, it was too late. The door shifted, as if inviting him to go deeper. A whisper echoed from beyond, soft and haunting. It sounded like a voice he had almost forgotten a thread to his past he could never ignore.</p>

        <p>Hana stared at the coffee cup, noticing how cold it had become. Her husband, Said, had already left, his silent departure echoing through their quiet apartment. They hadn’t spoken that morning. just the usual click of the door as he went out, leaving her to the hum of the fridge and her drifting thoughts.
            She thought of summer mornings back in Beirut, where her family would drink coffee in the courtyard, laughing and sharing gossip under the sun. Her aunties would always say, “It’s just a phase. Every couple has them.” But this silence felt heavy, more than just a phase.
            Without reheating the coffee, Hana tossed on a scarf, grabbed her keys, and stepped outside. Maybe a walk would help her find the words she couldn’t say, or at least the warmth she missed.</p>
